To run this SCB problem with FADO:
1. Go to CalGeo and Run CalGeo.py (technically you should specify the .su2 file for input, but it's already in by default)
2. After CalGeo.py executed successfully, you should see a bunch of .nam files. Move *.nam to the root directory of this problem
3. Go the the root directory for this problem, and open SCB.inp
4. Make sure the include tags all points to the respective .nam files' absolute directory
5. Open RunOptim.py and specify the number of CPU you'd like to use
6. Run python3 RunOptim.py
